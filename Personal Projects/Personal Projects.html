    <h1>Personal Projects</h1>
    </header>

    <p>This is a page mainly about personal stuff I'd like to do in the future. I'm a pretty creative guy, so, I'd like to keep everything here.</p>
    <p>(This will not have any school work in it because It is very rare for me to have a school project last more than a week.)</p>
