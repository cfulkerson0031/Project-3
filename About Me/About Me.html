    <p>My name is Cameron Fulkerson, I am a 20-year-old Autistic adult. My autism allowed me to be really into video games as a child. However, I do have other hobbies, like watching movies and cooking. I am studying computer science, hoping to enter the video game world one day, But website development has actually been pretty fun for me, so I might actually pursue a career in that. I also have other goals, like making a difference in the world, In fact, I have no hesitation about expressing myself.</p>
